# 2048 Desktop Game

This project is an implementation of the 2048 game for desktop using plain JavaScript. The game field is a 4x4 grid, where each cell can be empty or contain one of the numbers: 2, 4, 8, and so on. Players can move cells using keyboard arrows.

- After each move, a random empty cell receives the number 2 or 4 with a 10% probability.
- Display of a win message when the number 2048 appears in any cell.
- Display of a game over message when no more moves are available.
